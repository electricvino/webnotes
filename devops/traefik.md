# Traefik

without dashboard looks like all routing is handled through [IngressRoutes](https://dev.to/sklarsa/k3s-traefik-ingress-configured-for-your-homelab-58lc).
In docker looks like it mostly handled through labels applied to container.

[[k3s]]  can reference [Traefik docs](https://doc.traefik.io/traefik/user-guides/crd-acme/)
