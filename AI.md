## AI



* Narrow AI(Weak AI): performs narrow task such as facial recognition or driving a car.
* Reactive Machines: Reacts to stimuli, like movements on a chessboard, spam filters or recommendation services.
* Limited Memory AI: store knowledge, learn from it and perform new tasks. This is where Generative AI falls.
* Theory of Mind AI:  having true decision making capabilities similar to humans.
* Self-Aware AI: level of consciousness and intelligence similar to humans.

### Generative AI Types
* Text
* Image
* Sound
* Video

### Types other than Generative
* Computer Vision (CV): Classify and generate image data.
* Natural Language Processing (NLP): Neural network based algorithms used to classify and generate text data.
* Machine Learning: Finds patterns in large amounts of data and perform tasks like prediction, classification, and generation.
  * Supervised Learning: Telling program correct output until it learns.
  * Unsupervised Learning: gives program lots of data and allows it to make its own connections.
* Neural Networks: Information Processing Units serving as foundation for various AI methods.
  * Generative Adversarial Networks: 2 neural networks duking it out, with one generating new data and the other judging it until it matches criteria.
  * Deep Learning: Machine learning with neural networks.  Not shallow but computationally intensive.
  * Reinforcement Learning: Calibrating through penalty/reward system.
